        </h2>
        <p>
            My name is Jennifer Akpieyi, I am <em> 18 </em> years old.My birthday is on the 13<sup>th</sup> of February 2005.<br>
            I am from Nigeria. I have three siblings and I love them so much.
                 I lived in Lagos all my life and I moved to Canada about a year ago.
             <br>Then I took the design foundation program for about <em> 5 </em> months then later changed paths.
        </p>
        <p>
            I took up a job at Bayshore Mall throughout the summer break and when I resumed school, I entered the Interactive Media Design program.
             <br>I love watching movies and different shows. I am a sucker for horror and thriller action movies.
              My favourite thing to watch is currently the <abbr title=" Marvel Cinematic Universe">MCU</abbr>
